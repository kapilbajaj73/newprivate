5. Upload a logo or use their icon generator
6. Under "Permissions", select:
   - Internet access
   - Microphone access
7. Click "Generate APK"
8. Download your APK (takes 3-5 minutes)

This is the MOST RELIABLE OPTION and avoids all the build issues you're facing.

## OPTION 2: GoNative.io (No Coding Required)

## OPTION 3: Simple APK Creator Tool (Command Line)
---------------------------------------------

If you prefer a local tool:

1. Download the Simple APK Creator tool from its GitHub page:
   https://github.com/AppLozic/WebView-To-APK

2. Run the following command (after installing):
   ```
   webview-to-apk create --url="https://secure-conference-1-kapilbajaj730.replit.app/" --name="Onra Voice" --package="com.onravoice.app"
   ```

3. The tool will generate a simple APK with no build issues

## OPTION 4: Use a Pre-built WebView App
-----------------------------------

Several apps in the Google Play Store can load your URL directly:

1. Install "WebView Browser" or "WebView App" from Google Play
2. Enter your URL: https://secure-conference-1-kapilbajaj730.replit.app/
3. Save as a bookmark or homepage

## Why Android Studio keeps failing:
------------------------------

The build issues you're experiencing are very common with Android development:
- Version mismatches between Gradle, Android Gradle Plugin, JDK, and Android SDK
- System configuration differences
- Complex build system dependencies

Rather than spending hours troubleshooting, using one of the options above will save you significant time and frustration.
